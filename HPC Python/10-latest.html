<body>TACC HPC Python&nbsp; October 30, 2014 9:00am - 12:00pm<br
/><br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>Welcome!<br
/>Please submit questions at the bottom of this page.<br
/>loud and clear<br
/><br
/><br
/>'cp:missing destination file operand after '/home1/..../python-hpc.tar.gz<br
/>Can you tell what I'm doing wrong?<br
/>Nevermind. No . after command<br
/><br
/><br
/>Hello. Someone there?<br
/>Hello.<br
/>I'm not able to submit an interactive job to the TACC-HPC-PYTHON account:<br
/>User dssussx is not associated with project TACC-HPC-PYTHON (in accounting_check_prod.pl).<br
/>Online users may use a regular idev session.<br
/>The TACC-HPC-PYTHON account is reserved for local users only.<br
/><br
/>What do we do after we log in?<br
/>module load intel/14.0.1.106<br
/>module load python/2.7.6<br
/>and "cp ~train00/python-hpc.tar.gz ."&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>With idev command:<br
/>Please report this problem:<br
/>what problem?<br
/>U. of TX users contact (<a href="https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/consulting)">https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/consulting)</a><br
/>XSEDE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; users contact (<a href="https://portal.xsede.org/group/xup/help-desk)">https://portal.xsede.org/group/xup/help-desk)</a>.<br
/>FAILED<br
/>What command are you attempting? Just "idev"?<br
/><br
/><br
/><br
/>What do we do after "cp ~train00/python-hpc.tar.gz"?<br
/>tar -xzf python-hpc.tar.gz<br
/>I got this error:<br
/>login4.stampede(7)$ tar -fxz python-hpc.tar.gz<br
/>try "tar -xzf python-hpc.tar.gz"&nbsp;<br
/>(I'm quite surprised that the sequence of options makes a difference)<br
/>tar: You must specify one of the `-Acdtrux' or `--test-label'&nbsp; options<br
/>Try `tar --help' or `tar --usage' for more information.<br
/>login4.stampede(8)$&nbsp;<br
/>Are we just trying to untar this file?<br
/>Yes.<br
/>Okay. I will look online for how to do this.<br
/><br
/>I used srun instead of idev to get a compute node. Is that okay?<br
/>That should be okay.<br
/><br
/>Can the speaker move his terminal window down? I want to see the top of the current slide. I believe it shows us how to run the job. Is this correct? Are we running profiling.py?<br
/>python -m cProfile profiling.py<br
/><br
/>The slides should be available online:<br
/><a href="https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/user-services/training/hpc-python">https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/user-services/training/hpc-python</a><br
/>I found them!!<br
/><br
/><br
/>I get a ERROR: Cell magic `%%cython` not found.<br
/>How did you start your ipython session?<br
/>did you do the "%load_ext"?<br
/>(and on what machine are you?)<br
/>let me try again<br
/>yeah load_ext solved ti<br
/><br
/>Not sure what to do here:<br
/>login4.stampede(38)$ icc -shared -fPIC -03 myfunc -o myfun1.so -I$TACC_PYTHON_INC/python2.7/<br
/>icc: command line warning #10006: ignoring unknown option '-03'<br
/>That's a letter Oh, not digit zero<br
/>icc: error #10236: File not found:&nbsp; 'myfunc'<br
/>you forgot the ".c" extension<br
/>icc: command line error: no files specified; for help type "icc -help"<br
/>login4.stampede(39)$&nbsp;<br
/>Same error. Where did myfunc1.c come from?<br
/>from the command "cython myfunc1.pyx" (thankyou) (I missed that)<br
/>I retried it b/c I had a typo. Here's what I got:<br
/>login4.stampede(40)$ icc -shared -fPIC -03 myfunc1.c -o myfun1.so -I$TACC_PYTHON_INC/python2.7/<br
/>icc: command line warning #10006: ignoring unknown option '-03'<br
/>letter Oh, not digit zero: -03 vs -O3<br
/><br
/><br
/>whats inside $TACC_PYTHON_INC/python2.7/<br
/>just "ls" it.<br
/>my times are greater than what you get<br
/>on stampede? do you at least get an improvement in the same way as the teacher?<br
/>By how much?<br
/>almost twice&nbsp;<br
/>let me check on the improvement<br
/>I should compare test_python vs test_cython right?<br
/><br
/><br
/>Thanks for the link to the tutorial!<br
/><br
/>Okay I can do the cython myfunc3.pyx and the icc line without error. I generate an executable "myfunc3", but when I do "python test_cython3.py" I get an error:<br
/>"Import error: no module named myfunc3"<br
/>Any idea?<br
/>I guess the .so files are not being generated<br
/>I might have missed the part where he said how to do that<br
/>Are you compiling the way that Antonio shows on the slides?<br
/>I do the line starting with cython then the line starting with icc verbatim. Then python test_whatever<br
/>Hmm. So the .so is being generated, but then the function call in test_cython3.py cannot find it?<br
/>are you getting any errors? do a cut/paste of your terminal session.<br
/>here's how it works for me:<br
/>1. run cython:<br
/>cython myfunc3.pyx&nbsp;<br
/>login4.stampede(29)$ ls<br
/>myfunc1.pyx&nbsp; myfunc2.pyx&nbsp; myfunc3.c&nbsp; myfunc3.pyx<br
/>2. compile:<br
/>icc -fPIC -shared myfunc3.c -o myfunc3.so -I$TACC_PYTHON_INC/python2.7<br
/>login4.stampede(33)$ python test_cython3.py&nbsp;<br
/>7.4535600368e+13<br
/><br
/><br
/><br
/>So if I want to do this using my own python installation what would I give for TACC_PYTHON_INC/python2.7/<br
/>hm. do "find / -name cellobject.h"<br
/>that's the directory you need.<br
/>This is the include directory for your particular version of Python.<br
/>thanks<br
/><br
/><br
/>What is mean by broadcasting again?<br
/>This is referring to sending/receiving variables within an MPI enabled code.<br
/>Different MPI tasks each have unique values for variables within an MPI code.<br
/>Broadcast is a way to send to each task a value(s) to other tasks.<br
/>More about this later in Antonio's presentation.<br
/>Thanks.<br
/><br
/>What is meant by MIC? Using the MIC?<br
/>Many Integrated Cores<br
/>That's another name fr the Intel Xeon Phi co-processor&nbsp;<br
/>on the stampede nodes<br
/>Thanks for explaining that.<br
/><br
/>Since we can't use the MIC on the Login node, how do we get off the login node, or can we?<br
/>start an idev session: that puts you on a compute node, and they all have a MIC<br
/>(idev usually starts in the development queue; you can also use the normal-mic queue)<br
/>Okay then. Thanks!<br
/><br
/>How do you decide on 240 as a number for MIC_OMP_NUM_THREADS<br
/>60 cores times 4 threads<br
/>But a node has only 16 cores ?<br
/>The node has 2 sandybridges of 8 cores, correct.<br
/>The MIC is a separate co-processor; it has 60 cores<br
/>note the variable name MIC_OMP_NUM_THREADS, as opposed to OMP_NUM_THREADS<br
/><br
/><br
/>My time did not improve on that last example. I don't know why?<br
/>what is the output of "hostname -a"?<br
/>login4.stampede(77)$ hostname -a<br
/>login4<br
/>You need to be on a compute node in order to use a MIC.<br
/>Please refrain from running this code on the login node -- it will affect performance for other users.<br
/>same here no improvement hostname c559-101<br
/>Try turning on the offload report environment variable to see if you are actually offloading.<br
/>export OFFLOAD_REPORT=2<br
/>If you are offloading while running your code, you will receive extra output telling you.<br
/>Do you see this when you run?<br
/>No I donot see extra output<br
/>Can you double check your environment variables and their values?<br
/>sure<br
/>export MKL_MIC_ENABLE=1<br
/>export OMP_NUM_THREADS=16<br
/>export MIC_OMP_NUM_THREADS=240<br
/>export OFFLOAD_REPORT=2<br
/>echo $OMP_NUM_THREADS $MKL_MIC_ENABLE $MIC_OMP_NUM_THREADS $OFFLOAD_REPORT&nbsp;<br
/>16 1 240 2<br
/>Yeah they are all there<br
/>Would please output which modules you are using with "module list"?<br
/>Currently Loaded Modules:<br
/>&nbsp; 1) TACC-paths&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) cluster-paths&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) cluster&nbsp;&nbsp; 7) intel/13.0.2.146&nbsp;&nbsp; 9) fftw3/3.3.2<br
/>&nbsp; 2) Linux&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) xalt/0.4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6) TACC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8) mvapich2/1.9a2<br
/><br
/>Inactive Modules:<br
/>&nbsp; 1) python/2.7.6<br
/>Ahhh<br
/>:-) You need to load intel/14 to get the MIC enabled python/2.7.6.<br
/>Let me know if that works out.<br
/>Yeah worked out<br
/>Great!<br
/><br
/><br
/><br
/>I did not get output here.<br
/>login4.stampede(75)$ python basic_1.py&nbsp;<br
/>[....]<br
/>_tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY environment variable<br
/>login4.stampede(76)$&nbsp;<br
/>when you connected to stampede, did you use ssh -X ? And do you have a X11 manager on your local computer?<br
/>I did not use ssh -X. I used ssh username@login.xsede.org I don't know if I have an X11 manager. I'm using a laptop with Ubuntu. If you have Ubuntu using ssx -X .... should fix the problem.<br
/>ssh -X user@host or ssh -Y user@host for Stampede should be sufficient for X11 tunneling and opening up X-windows.<br
/><br
/><br
/>What does hostname -a output if I am on a compute node?<br
/>How do I make sure I am using a compute node?<br
/>What are you getting (it varies for all of them)?<br
/>If you see login.... then it's a login, if you see c###-### it's a compute node.<br
/>Got it.<br
/><br
/>Could you tell me how to compute $MIC_OMP_NUM_THREADS&nbsp; for a node with 16 cores<br
/>Do you mean show the value of the environment variable $MIC_OMP_NUM_THREADS?<br
/>echo $MIC_OMP_NUM_THREADS<br
/>NO how did you come up with 240 number&nbsp;<br
/>Or is it default per node<br
/>If I am specifying it in a job script how will I doit<br
/><br
/>The node has 2 sandybridges of 8 cores, correct.<br
/>The MIC is a separate co-processor; it has 60 cores<br
/>note the variable name MIC_OMP_NUM_THREADS, as opposed to OMP_NUM_THREADS<br
/>It's part of the hardware of the Intel Xeon Phi Coprocessor (i.e. MIC).<br
/>Oh ok so does all nodes on stamped have MICs with 60 cores<br
/>Essentially all compute nodes. Not the login nodes. All our MICs are "the same" in the sense they have 60 cores.<br
/>Why multiply by 4 so&nbsp;<br
/>Because the MIC has 4 hardware threads<br
/>Thanks I will look this up<br

/><br
/>So is this available for any code that is compiled using MKL<br
/>With the intel compilers, yes.<br
/>Offload will be supported via OpenMP 4.0 in upcoming GCC compiler implementations as well.<br
/>Currently I have code compiled with Intel compilers an MKL in stampede. So If I specify MIC variables it will automatically offload to MIC right?<br
/>It depends on which MKL calls you are using, how big your matrices are.<br
/>Mainly tha LAPACK routines are used with pretty large matrices<br
/>Many routines are supported. I'm not sure which specific ones are but many of the 'popular' ones, as Antonio pointed out in the tutorial.<br
/><br
/>How do I get on a compute node? I want to run these examples.<br
/>I was on a compute node at one point but not anymore.<br
/><br
/>idev -t 2:00:00<br

/><br
/>Thank you for that great presentation. The last part on mpi4py was difficutl for me to follow. However, overall, I learned a lot.<br
